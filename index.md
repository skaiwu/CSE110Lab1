## Who I am as a Programmer  
If you would like to know more about me, go [here](##Who I am as a Person).
I would consider myself to be a decently expereinced programmer, but by no means am I saying I am great or even good.  I have held 2 internship positions and currently still work one of them part time.  I've done a decent amount of coding, but below are the three most important lines of code that I think everyone programmer needs to use.
```
git add .
git commit -m
git push
```
Here is a separate tutorial made by [git](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) that shows you how to use these commands.

If I had to rank my favorite colleges in UCSD, it would be something like this.
1. New Sixth
2. Warren
3. Literally every other college
In the words of me
>Sixth is goated, Warren is my school, and who cares about the rest
